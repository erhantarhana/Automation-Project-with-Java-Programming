Flight Ticket Sales Automation Project



In order to use the system, four different types of users (Admin, Manager, Employee, Passenger) will be created.

In this project there are features such as

- Admin will be able to record, delete, edit and list manager, employee and passenger information in the system, as well as record, delete, edit and list aircraft and flight information. All these transactions are recorded and only the admin user has access to view and delete them,
- The administrator will be able to record, delete, edit and list employee and passenger information in the system, as well as record, delete, edit and list aircraft and flight information. All these transactions are recorded and the administrator does not have access to these records,
- The employee will be able to record, delete, edit and list the passenger information in the system, as well as list the aircraft and flight information. All these transactions are recorded and the employee does not have access to these records,
- After the passenger logs into the system with the registered user name and password, all suitable flights will be listed on the screen. In accordance with the total credit registered in the system, the passenger can buy a ticket from the flight he wants and increase his credit if it is not suitable. The tickets he has bought will be displayed on the My Flights page and he can cancel any of these tickets. After the cancellation, the passenger's credit is deleted up to the penalty points specified in the flight,
- Admin, manager, employee and passenger users will be able to access and edit their personal information through their own profile,
- The message sending module is designed for employees and passengers to communicate with the admin or manager. On this screen, the admin and administrator will be able to access from which user the message came, the content of the message and the time it was sent, as well as delete the desired message.

- The information recorded and edited in the project is kept in .txt files.
